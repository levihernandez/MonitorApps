# MonitorApps

A sample app named `MonitorApps` written in AngularJS uses Datadog RUM to track user activity.

The Datadog javascript code is in the `js/datadog.js` file and it is included in the `index.html` file. 
This is optional as the code in itself can be included within a `<script></script>` tag.

    * `css/bootstrap.css`
    * `css/bootstrap.min.css`
    * `js/bootstrap.js`
